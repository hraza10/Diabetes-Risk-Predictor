# Diabetes-Risk-Predictor
Predicted diabetes risk by applying Scikit-learnâ€™s logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models, achieving up to 95% accuracy by analyzing key health features such as age, BMI, and Hemoglobin A1C levels. Engineered features by data wrangling, encoding categorical variables, and StandardScaler preprocessing. Merged and split data into training, testing, and holdout subsets, implementing 5-fold cross-validation. Computed demographics classification reports and confusion matrices, visualizing using Seaborn heat maps.
